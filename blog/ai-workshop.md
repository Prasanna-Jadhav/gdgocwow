# Empowering Women in AI: GDG OC WOW Workshop Recap

*Published: April 20, 2025*

## Introduction

Last weekend, GDG OC WOW (Women of Web) hosted its first-ever dedicated AI workshop, bringing together women developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts from across Orange County. The event aimed to demystify artificial intelligence tools and provide hands-on experience with the latest technologies that are reshaping the tech landscape.

## Workshop Highlights

### Keynote: "The Future of AI in Web Development"

The day began with an inspiring keynote from Dr. Sarah Chen, AI Research Lead at Google, who shared insights on how AI is transforming web development and creating new opportunities for developers. Dr. Chen emphasized that "AI is not replacing developers but augmenting their capabilities, allowing them to focus on creative problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks."

### Hands-on Sessions

The workshop featured three parallel tracks:

1. **AI Basics for Beginners**
   - Introduction to machine learning concepts
   - Setting up development environments
   - Building your first ML model with TensorFlow

2. **Integrating AI into Web Applications**
   - Working with pre-trained models
   - API integration techniques
   - User experience considerations for AI features

3. **Advanced AI Implementation**
   - Fine-tuning large language models
   - Responsible AI development practices
   - Performance optimization strategies

### Project Showcase

Participants formed groups to work on mini-projects applying what they learned. Some notable projects included:

- An accessibility enhancement tool using computer vision
- A content recommendation system for blogs
- A real-time translation widget for multilingual websites

## Community Impact

The workshop addressed the gender gap in AI development by providing women with resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities specific to this fast-growing field. According to post-event surveys, 87% of participants reported feeling more confident about pursuing AI-related projects after attending.

"I've been hesitant to dive into AI because it seemed so complex," shared attendee Jamie Rodriguez. "This workshop broke things down in a way that made me realize I can absolutely incorporate these technologies into my work."

## Resources Shared

Workshop materials are now available to the community:

- Presentation slides and code samples
- Tutorial videos for each session
- Recommended learning paths for continued education
- Discord channel for ongoing support and collaboration

## Looking Ahead

Building on the success of this event, GDG OC WOW plans to host monthly AI coding sessions and a more comprehensive workshop series in the fall. The community is also launching a mentorship program specifically focused on supporting women entering the AI field.
